21:44:14 machinehum | So from what I've read on length matching ddr3: clocks should be 10mils, address should be 125mils, DQ/DSQ/DM (Same
                    | byte group) should be 50 mils. However I'm unsure about !CAS/!RAS/!CKE/!CS/!WE/!RST/ODT. Does anyone have a doc for
                    | the rest of these suckers?

22:01:17 azonenberg | machinehum: CAS/RAS/CS/WE are part of the address group and synchronous to the main clock
22:01:25 azonenberg | they run at x1 rate so same constraints as the address bus
22:01:47 azonenberg | CKE, RST, ODT are as well, although depending on how the board is laid out some of those signals may be tied to
                    | constant values and thus not have any constraints
22:02:01 azonenberg | if they're driven by the fpga side treat them as address lines for layout
22:02:40 azonenberg | What FPGA are you using? there's normally fairly decent layout guidelines from the vendors
22:02:52 azonenberg | that said, ddr is ddr no matter what fpga is driving it so the same guidelines apply anywhere
22:03:01 azonenberg | other than specifics about which pins on the fpga are used for what purpose
22:04:25 azonenberg | In the case of Xilinx 7 series, UG586 is the document to read. The DDR3 design guidelines section starts at page
                    | 181 in my document version but it's an old rev so the page numbering may have changed a little bit
22:04:28 azonenberg | it's in that range though
22:05:15 azonenberg | Any details about which pins are used FPGA side is xilinx specific but general stuff about layout, power,
                    | termination, and length matching is generic
22:05:48 azonenberg | also if you havent done this already, grab the package files for your FPGA of choice. there should be a data file
                    | that lists in-package delays from the I/O pad drivers on the silicon to the BGA ball
22:06:06 azonenberg | You need to take those delays into account when matching
22:06:18 azonenberg | Also keep in mind internal and external trace propagation velocity is not the same
22:06:27 azonenberg | You aren't actually matching *length*, you're matching *delay*
22:06:32 azonenberg | length is a proxy for delay
22:06:51 azonenberg | I prefer to work in time domain units for all of the calculations then convert the allowed delays back to length
                    | units for layout purposes
22:08:01 azonenberg | On page 187 of UG586 (doc rev 2.0, again page numbering may be different in later revs) there's a "trace lengths"
                    | section that lists allowable skew in picoseconds

0:01:59 azonenberg | machinehum: well in that case look at controller docs for that. But still try to get package skew values if
                   | possible, especially on larger BGAs they can be significant
0:02:26 azonenberg | and like i said do your matching in the time domain, and only convert to spatial units at the very end once you
                   | know what the target delay for your trace is and what layer it's going to be on
0:02:32 azonenberg | if you jump between layers it gets even more fun
0:03:49 azonenberg | machinehum: https://www.antikernel.net/temp/maxwell-ram-matching.png
0:04:06 azonenberg | this is a big spreadsheet i built for one of my projects to lay out a 64-bit ddr3 sodimm
0:04:26 azonenberg | This is handled by the tooling in some cases i think, if you have high dollar tool suites from cadence or maybe
                   | altium
0:04:35 azonenberg | for the rest of us, excel is your friend
